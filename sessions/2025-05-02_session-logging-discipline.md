Session Title: Session Logging Discipline & Export Versioning Protocol  
Date: 2025-05-02  

Objectives:  
- Define clear criteria for when a prompting session is complete  
- Create decision logic for when to log sessions  
- Establish versioning standards for exported chats  
- Clarify structure and lifecycle of chat exports within PromptOps

---

Context Summary:  
This session explored the boundaries of what constitutes a log-worthy prompt session versus disposable interactions. It clarified how session logs relate to prompt creation, prompt chains, insights, and multi-chat workflows. It also defined the rules for exporting and versioning raw chat logs and when they deserve permanent tracking.

---

Prompt(s) Used:  
- Ad hoc instructional prompts used to clarify schema standards, session behavior, export logic, and prompt lifecycle structure

---

Outcome: Success

---

Key Insights:
- A session is log-worthy if it contributes to long-term prompt systems, insights, frameworks, or product IP â€” not only when it produces a prompt directly
- Session logs consolidate **multiple chats into a single narrative**, as long as they pursue the same outcome
- Chat exports should only be versioned when meaningful evolution occurs (new insights, redirection, restructuring)
- Final prompts go to `/prompts/`, raw exports to `/private_exports/`, and polished `.md` versions to the `ai-ops-site` repo if public-facing
- This session established foundational logic for scaling a structured R&D-to-product pipeline
