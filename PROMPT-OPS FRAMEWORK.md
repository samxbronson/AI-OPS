# PROMPT-OPS FRAMEWORK

This is a **founder-grade operational framework. A** **strategic protocol for AI-driven problem solving**. It aligns perfectly with enterprise-level thinking and early-stage company scaffolding.

---

## **Prompt-Ops Execution Framework v1.0**

### **1. Define Success**

> Outcome-Driven Clarity:
> 
> 
> Write *one sentence* defining what success looks like. It must be *measurable* and *immediately observable*.
> 

**Example:**

“Generate a 500-word content brief that aligns with our cybersecurity thought leadership angle for LinkedIn.”

---

### **2. Process Mapping**

> Input → Transformation → Output
> 

| Phase | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Input** | What are you feeding in (data, goals, examples)? |
| **Transformation** | What is the AI doing (synthesizing, translating, formatting)? |
| **Output** | What must come out, in what format, and why? |

---

### **3. First Win Focus**

> Small, Fast, Validated Output
> 

Don’t build the whole machine. Identify the lowest-effort test that:

- Proves the core transformation works
- Reduces uncertainty
- Generates something reusable

---

### **4. Prompt Architecture**

> Prompt = Role + Access + Objective + Constraints
> 

| Component | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Role** | "You are a cybersecurity content strategist..." |
| **Access** | "You have access to prior briefs and industry tone guidelines..." |
| **Objective** | "Generate a pitch for a blue-team product targeting CISOs..." |
| **Constraints** | "Limit to 300 words, formal tone, 3 key points, no fluff..." |

---

### **5. Modular Chaining**

> Chain = Raw → Refine → Format → Critique
> 

Structure complex prompts into *steps*:

- Step 1: Generate rough list
- Step 2: Select and refine
- Step 3: Format for delivery
- Step 4: Self-critique or run QA prompt

---

### **6. Validation**

> Strategic Effect Check
> 

Ask:

- Did this reduce decision fatigue?
- Did it shorten execution time?
- Did it replace or enhance a process?

If *yes*, save and name the prompt. If *no*, diagnose.

---

### **7. Prompt Forensics**

> Failure = Signal
> 

Was the issue:

- Input ambiguity?
- Transformation misalignment?
- Output formatting mismatch?

Adjust *one* variable and rerun. Never change everything at once.

---

### **8. IP Capture Loop**

> Prompt → Result → Template → Archive
> 
- Name each working prompt
- Version it (v1.1, v1.2...)
- Tag by use-case
- Add to PromptDB (with linked outputs, notes)
- Abstract it into a Framework if used 3+ times

---

## **R&D Ops Layering**

| Layer | Purpose | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PromptDB** | Raw prompt logs, metadata, version history | Notion, Airtable |
| **R&D Memos** | Structured experiment notes | Obsidian, Notion |
| **Frameworks** | Distilled repeatable systems | Docs, Wiki, Miro |
